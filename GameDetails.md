Game Name: Attack on Revature (The Game)

Character Creation and Battle system.

Ideas:

1. Randomly generate characters with "fair" stats from the API.
2. Client Side storage/rendering.
3. Turn-based
4. Character Creation (distribute points).

Character Attributes (100 points distributed):
1. Strength (Integer)
2. Life (Integer > 20) (5 pts of HP per life stat).
3. Dex (dodge %) (INTEGER)
4. Speed (who goes first) (INTEGER)
5. Image (Character Apperance) (URL)


Battle System (tournament style):

1. Put name in at beginning.
2. Look at Rating(like chess)
3. Choose a Character(From list or randomize one).
4. Fight
5. After win/loss move up bracket or lose END.

Storage:
1. User Information (local storage)
2. Log of game results.
3. H2
